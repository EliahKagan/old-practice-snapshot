# Binary minheap + map implementation scratchwork.

In C# and in Ruby.

This data structure applies to:

- Prim's algorithm (for finding a minimum spanning tree).

- Dijkstra's algorithm (for finding shortest paths from a source to all
  destinations).

I've most often reimplemented this for particular problems or clusters of
problems, however.

See also `../heap`.
