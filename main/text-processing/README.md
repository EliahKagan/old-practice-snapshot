# HackerRank: Text Processing

I've put all the HackerRank [Linux Shell - Text
Processing](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=textpro)
files in one second-level directory, rather than in separate directories per
challenge/exercise. This is because there are many small files and placing them
in separate directories doesn't seem like it would improve organization or
navigability.

One of the reasons I don't think putting them in separate directories would help
is that these files seem incomplete--it seems there should be more files. But
I'm not investigating that at this time.
