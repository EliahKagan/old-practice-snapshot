# Lower Bound

This is an implementation of the lower-bound algorithm&mdash;a form of binary
search that finds the leftmost insertion point for a value, i.e., the first
value that compares equal to it or, if there is no such value, the first
occurrences of the lowest value that is present and greater than it, or if there
is no such value, then one past the end of the array.

I *think* this was for personal practice, not involving any website / online
judge.
