# `alloca` exercise

This was for personal practice / experimentation, and not related to any website
or online judge.

My original filenames (before being placed in this directory tree) were
`stack0.c`, `stack1.c`, and `stack.c`. I've renamed the first two to
`stack.c.bak0` and `stack.c.bak1` since I regard them to be snapshots of earlier
versions of the program. On the main branch these all collapse to separate
commits for `stack.c`.
