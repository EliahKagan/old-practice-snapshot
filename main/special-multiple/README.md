# Special Multiple

This is the HackerRank problem [Special
Multiple](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/special-multiple). I submitted a
successful solution to this about five years ago, at around the same time as I
created the file `special-multiple-scratch.linq`, which is dated to then. But
either I never saved the submission locally, or I saved it to a different
computer and never copied it to the source directory here.

I've retrieved the submitted successful solution from HackerRank and saved it as
`special-multiple.cs`. Since I don't have a specific date and time at which I
created or submitted it (HackerRank just says "five years ago") I'm not
backdating this to an earlier-dated commit.
